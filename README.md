# 3D Tile Viewer

This is a react application that leverages `deckgl`, `cesium` and `mapboxgl` to render custom 3d tiles from CityJSON.
The viewer provides 3 data levels: 
    - `Level of Detail 1.2 (LOD 12)`
    - `Level of Detail 1.3 (LOD 13)`
    - `Level of Detail 2.0 (LOD 2)`

The different LODs describe the buildings in details from simple extrusion to custom rooftops.
